Urban food scrap collection & compost #relyoneachother

Separating organic matter from household trash is the first step in changing ingrained habits of consumption. It immediately disrupts the human food linkages systemically. It brings into clearer view our other contributions to the waste stream -- namely plastic and other hybrid non-biodegradable materials.

Cities are moving to mandatory organic waste diversion and composting programs. It will be critical to provide accurate and near real-time information on the location and collection points of organic waste. Missing is the data to inform  and track participation in waste diversion programs and onsite composting. Harnessing human energy will be essential to the projects success.

One could argue we are at a place in time where the science is in yet the existing methods to put that science to good effect are lagging. Climate change is here but are we?

It falls on recycling [sigh] to mitigate the environmental burden of human food waste and it's mixed bag of technical and biological products. Conservation efforts inch along. Many of us, in our heart of hearts, believe in recycling and conservation yet our inner autonomous consumer is conflicted at the expense of rational thought. Cheese curls. Just sayin'. Many of the many actively participate while overlooking the considerable energy spent creating and distributing the stuff we end up separating and disposing. A cities food has often traveled thousands of kilometers before ending up rotting in refrigeration. Carbon +1. The verticality and population density of urban zones pose unique conditions that will have to be addressed.

In this use case technology both is and is not the answer. Food waste being a wholly user-centered experience will require a wholly user-centered intervention. We all know, as much as we try to ignore it, what we are throwing into our waste cans. YouTube mutts, while entertainingly loyal and cute table scrap diverters, as alternative digesters should *not* be scalable. The platform should be knitted around the idea of "open by design" (Bloom, 2015. "WITH AND OF AND BY AND FOR") and with any luck eventually disappear into the background.

All designed information systems are at their root human systems and can only function through the relationships of the people within those systems. Social apps, by example, take on the structures of woven materials much like is now being observed in brain neural networks. We use patterns to flag random associations. We turn these patterns and associations into maps. What kills any great idea, besides bad timing, is a design so onerous it suffocates the desire of users to explore random associations. I experience this every time I'm encouraged to log into LinkedIn and Google+. I'm sorry, I don't mean to pile on, but wtf?

So the food(scraps) to compost story aka Compost Club is obviously one of science and observation, the conversion of energy through decay, but it's also a story about converting human energy, enabling and building out the interchanges within neighborhoods and learning to be accountable for everything in our waste stream. Lastly, it's about changing habits. The tools are readily available to support collaboration, share activity and most importantly provide the channels to connect with each other. At this point we have no choice but to. Or maybe we already have?

Look at the center of any disruptive idea, you'll always find an activist with questions.

## Question, questions

* Can we visualize food waste to compost participation over time? Is there even data to measure this? If not, can it be inferred by other means?

* How does metadata inform participation?

## Inputs

* Metadata
* Data
* Tests
* Surveys and polls

## Rules of CompostandCompany
* Rule 1 keep it close to home
* Rule 2 keep it close to home
* Rule 3 relationships = trust
* Rule 4 {measure ~ data ~ truth} 
* Rule 5 No truth? then Rule 4

## Some Assumptions

* My planet will have soil, air and water free of man-made chemical pollutants.
* Reduce ~ Reuse ~ Recycle loop bad. Waste ~ Decay loop good. 
* Planned obsolescence must die!
* Global climate changes profound impact on water resources is the visible threat that crosses all geographic zones.
* Cities are food scrap machines. Doh.
* Using economies of scale can facilitate a consistent & reliable product.
* Adding composted organic matter innoculates, improves water retention and provides plant nutrients.
* Soils rich in beneficial organisms become carbon sponges.
* Compost is a natural "nearly free" resource unlike water.

## Possible Outcomes

* Creative ideation
* Field data collection 
* Event / Media campaigns
* Metadata, datasets & APIs
* Explore sensors
* GCFS (General Compost Standard)
* Maps, maps, maps
* Viz, viz, visu-a-li-zation
* Discourse/Slack chat
* Fun

Rewards
* Fun
* Stickers
* Hemp bags4Bikes
* Some really special secret stuff
