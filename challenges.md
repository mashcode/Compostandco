Urban Decay -- Challenges
=========

Development of an open platform to facilitate and track organic waste diversion is immediately disruptive. Which is...disruptive. Large population centers will have to rely on basic human relationships within neighborhood networks and virtual contact with external city services. Simple Pub/Sub notification can help reduce friction. 

Data generated and collected will be mapped. Development of an app and device designed to easily locate and plot basic activity with environmental data will mean addressing both the propaganda & reality of privacy. New York City for example is about the street. Since life happens on the street the home becomes the sanctuary. [Placemeter's](http://placemeter.com/about) approach is I think a great model for navigating this monumental issue.

Is 100% food scrap diversion into compost even a viable goal? Are there other by-products that might be harvested from the organic waste stream?
