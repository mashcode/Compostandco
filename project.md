Urban Decay -- Project
=========

Model and network neighborhood food scrap diversion using crowd-sourced metadata

Even more important will be the development of the open-source tools and methods to track and monitor the health of organic urban compost.

*Roadmap*

With _keep it close to home_ in mind the first step in this project is to collect and map the compost collection and drop-off locations within the city and begin measuring.

Set up Discourse as a messaging portal and Ckan as data portal. Publish everything.

Design a cheap/portable temperature sensor to monitor the health of compost, alert users and managers, and provide information on remediation.
